# Ultralytics HUB Integrations

Learn about [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) integrations with various platforms and formats.

## Datasets

Seamlessly import your datasets in [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) for [model training](./models.md#train-model).

After a dataset is imported in [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub), you can [train a model](./models.md#train-model) on your dataset just like you would using the [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) datasets.

### Roboflow

You can easily filter the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) datasets on the [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) [Datasets](https://hub.ultralytics.com/datasets) page.

[Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) supports two types of integrations with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics), [Universe](#universe) and [Workspace](#workspace).

#### Universe

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Universe integration allows you to import one dataset at a time into [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics).

##### Import

When you export a [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset, select the [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) format. This action will redirect you to [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) and trigger the **Dataset Import** dialog.

You can import your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset by clicking on the **Import** button.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Dataset Import dialog with an arrow pointing to the Import button](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/ultralytics-hub-dataset-import-dialog.avif)

Next, [train a model](./models.md#train-model) on your dataset.

##### Remove

Navigate to the Dataset page of the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset you want to remove, open the dataset actions dropdown and click on the **Remove** option.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Dataset page of a Roboflow Universe dataset with an arrow pointing to the Remove option](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-universe-remove.avif)

??? tip

    You can remove an imported [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset directly from the [Datasets](https://hub.ultralytics.com/datasets) page.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Datasets page with an arrow pointing to the Remove option of one of the Roboflow Universe datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-remove-option.avif)

#### Workspace

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Workspace integration allows you to import an entire [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Workspace at once into [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub).

##### Import

Navigate to the [Integrations](https://hub.ultralytics.com/settings?tab=integrations) page by clicking on the **Integrations** button in the sidebar.

Type your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Workspace private API key and click on the **Add** button.

??? tip

    You can click on the **Get my API key** button which will redirect you to the settings of your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Workspace from where you can obtain your private API key.

This will connect your [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) account with your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Workspace and make your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) datasets available in [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub).

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Integrations page with an arrow pointing to one of the connected workspaces](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-workspace-import-2.avif)

Next, [train a model](./models.md#train-model) on your dataset.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Dataset page of a Roboflow Workspace dataset with an arrow pointing to the Train Model button](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/ultralytics-hub-dataset-train-model.avif)

##### Remove

Navigate to the [Integrations](https://hub.ultralytics.com/settings?tab=integrations) page by clicking on the **Integrations** button in the sidebar and click on the **Unlink** button of the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Workspace you want to remove.
