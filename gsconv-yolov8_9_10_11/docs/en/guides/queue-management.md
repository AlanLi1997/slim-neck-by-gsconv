## FAQ

### How can I use Ultralytics YOLOv8 for real-time queue management?

To use Ultralytics YOLOv8 for real-time queue management, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the YOLOv8 model with `YOLO("yolov8n.pt")`.
2. Capture the video feed using `cv2.VideoCapture`.
3. Define the region of interest (ROI) for queue management.
4. Process frames to detect objects and manage queues.

Here's a minimal example:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import YOLO, solutions

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video.mp4")
queue_region = [(20, 400), (1080, 404), (1080, 360), (20, 360)]

queue = solutions.QueueManager(
    names=model.names,
    reg_pts=queue_region,
    line_thickness=3,
)

while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if success:
        tracks = model.track(im0, show=False, persist=True, verbose=False)
        out = queue.process_queue(im0, tracks)
        cv2.imshow("Queue Management", im0)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
            break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Can Ultralytics YOLOv8 handle multiple types of queues, such as in airports and retail?

Yes, Ultralytics YOLOv8 can manage various types of queues, including those in airports and retail environments. By configuring the QueueManager with specific regions and settings, YOLOv8 can adapt to different queue layouts and densities.

Example for airports:

```python
queue_region_airport = [(50, 600), (1200, 600), (1200, 550), (50, 550)]
queue_airport = solutions.QueueManager(
    names=model.names,
    reg_pts=queue_region_airport,
    line_thickness=3,
)
```
