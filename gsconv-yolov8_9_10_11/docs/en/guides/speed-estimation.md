## FAQ

### How do I estimate object speed using Ultralytics YOLOv8?

Estimating object speed with Ultralytics YOLOv8 involves combining [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and tracking techniques. First, you need to detect objects in each frame using the YOLOv8 model. Then, track these objects across frames to calculate their movement over time. Finally, use the distance traveled by the object between frames and the frame rate to estimate its speed.

**Example**:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import YOLO, solutions

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
names = model.model.names

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")
w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter("speed_estimation.avi", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

# Initialize SpeedEstimator
speed_obj = solutions.SpeedEstimator(
    reg_pts=[(0, 360), (1280, 360)],
    names=names,
    view_img=True,
)

while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if not success:
        break
    tracks = model.track(im0, persist=True, show=False)
    im0 = speed_obj.estimate_speed(im0, tracks)
    video_writer.write(im0)

cap.release()
video_writer.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### How accurate is the speed estimation using Ultralytics YOLOv8?

The [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) of speed estimation using Ultralytics YOLOv8 depends on several factors, including the quality of the object tracking, the resolution and frame rate of the video, and environmental variables. While the speed estimator provides reliable estimates, it may not be 100% accurate due to variances in frame processing speed and object occlusion.

**Note**: Always consider margin of error and validate the estimates with ground truth data when possible.
