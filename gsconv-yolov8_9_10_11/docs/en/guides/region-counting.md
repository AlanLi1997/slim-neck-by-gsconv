## Steps to Run

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Begin by cloning the Ultralytics repository, installing dependencies, and navigating to the local directory using the provided commands in Step 2.

```bash
# Clone Ultralytics repo
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

# Navigate to the local directory
cd ultralytics/examples/YOLOv8-Region-Counter
```

### Step 2: Run Region Counting Using Ultralytics YOLOv8

Execute the following basic commands for inference.

???+ tip "Region is Movable"

    During video playback, you can interactively move the region within the video by clicking and dragging using the left mouse button.

```bash
# Save results
python yolov8_region_counter.py --source "path/to/video.mp4" --save-img

# Run model on CPU
python yolov8_region_counter.py --source "path/to/video.mp4" --device cpu

# Change model file
python yolov8_region_counter.py --source "path/to/video.mp4" --weights "path/to/model.pt"

# Detect specific classes (e.g., first and third classes)
python yolov8_region_counter.py --source "path/to/video.mp4" --classes 0 2

# View results without saving
python yolov8_region_counter.py --source "path/to/video.mp4" --view-img
```
