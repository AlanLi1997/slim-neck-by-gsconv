## Parking Management System Code Workflow

### Selection of Points

!!! tip "Point Selection is now Easy"

    Choosing parking points is a critical and complex task in parking management systems. Ultralytics streamlines this process by providing a tool that lets you define parking lot areas, which can be utilized later for additional processing.

- Capture a frame from the video or camera stream where you want to manage the parking lot.
- Use the provided code to launch a graphical interface, where you can select an image and start outlining parking regions by mouse click to create polygons.

!!! warning "Image Size"

    Max Image Size of 1920 * 1080 supported

!!! example "Parking slots Annotator Ultralytics YOLOv8"

    === "Parking Annotator"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import solutions

        solutions.ParkingPtsSelection()
        ```

- After defining the parking areas with polygons, click `save` to store a JSON file with the data in your working directory.
