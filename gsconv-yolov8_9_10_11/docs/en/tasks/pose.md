# Pose Estimation

<img width="1024" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/pose-estimation-examples.avif" alt="Pose estimation examples">

Pose estimation is a task that involves identifying the location of specific points in an image, usually referred to as keypoints. The keypoints can represent various parts of the object such as joints, landmarks, or other distinctive features. The locations of the keypoints are usually represented as a set of 2D `[x, y]` or 3D `[x, y, visible]` coordinates.

The output of a pose estimation model is a set of points that represent the keypoints on an object in the image, usually along with the confidence scores for each point. Pose estimation is a good choice when you need to identify specific parts of an object in a scene, and their location in relation to each other.

!!! tip

    YOLOv8 _pose_ models use the `-pose` suffix, i.e. `yolov8n-pose.pt`. These models are trained on the [COCO keypoints](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco-pose.yaml) dataset and are suitable for a variety of pose estimation tasks.

    In the default YOLOv8 pose model, there are 17 keypoints, each representing a different part of the human body. Here is the mapping of each index to its respective body joint:

    0: Nose
    1: Left Eye
    2: Right Eye
    3: Left Ear
    4: Right Ear
    5: Left Shoulder
    6: Right Shoulder
    7: Left Elbow
    8: Right Elbow
    9: Left Wrist
    10: Right Wrist
    11: Left Hip
    12: Right Hip
    13: Left Knee
    14: Right Knee
    15: Left Ankle
    16: Right Ankle

### Dataset format

YOLO pose dataset format can be found in detail in the [Dataset Guide](../datasets/pose/index.md). To convert your existing dataset from other formats (like COCO etc.) to YOLO format, please use [JSON2YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/JSON2YOLO) tool by Ultralytics.

## Val

Validate trained YOLOv8n-pose model [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) on the COCO128-pose dataset. No arguments are needed as the `model` retains its training `data` and arguments as model attributes.

        metrics.box.maps  # a list contains map50-95 of each category
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo pose val model=yolov8n-pose.pt  # val official model
        yolo pose val model=path/to/best.pt  # val custom model
        ```

        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.pt")  # load an official model
        model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom model

        # Predict with the model
        results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")  # predict on an image
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo pose predict model=yolov8n-pose.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'  # predict with official model
        yolo pose predict model=path/to/best.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'  # predict with custom model
        ```

See full `predict` mode details in the [Predict](../modes/predict.md) page.

## Export

Export a YOLOv8n Pose model to a different format like ONNX, CoreML, etc.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.pt")  # load an official model
        model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom trained model

        # Export the model
        model.export(format="onnx")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolov8n-pose.pt format=onnx  # export official model
        yolo export model=path/to/best.pt format=onnx  # export custom trained model
        ```

Available YOLOv8-pose export formats are in the table below. You can export to any format using the `format` argument, i.e. `format='onnx'` or `format='engine'`. You can predict or validate directly on exported models, i.e. `yolo predict model=yolov8n-pose.onnx`. Usage examples are shown for your model after export completes.

## FAQ

### What is Pose Estimation with Ultralytics YOLOv8 and how does it work?

Pose estimation with Ultralytics YOLOv8 involves identifying specific points, known as keypoints, in an image. These keypoints typically represent joints or other important features of the object. The output includes the `[x, y]` coordinates and confidence scores for each point. YOLOv8-pose models are specifically designed for this task and use the `-pose` suffix, such as `yolov8n-pose.pt`. These models are pre-trained on datasets like [COCO keypoints](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco-pose.yaml) and can be used for various pose estimation tasks. For more information, visit the [Pose Estimation Page](#pose-estimation).

### How can I train a YOLOv8-pose model on a custom dataset?

Training a YOLOv8-pose model on a custom dataset involves loading a model, either a new model defined by a YAML file or a pre-trained model. You can then start the training process using your specified dataset and parameters.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.yaml")  # build a new model from YAML
model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

# Train the model
results = model.train(data="your-dataset.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
```

For comprehensive details on training, refer to the [Train Section](#train).

### How do I validate a trained YOLOv8-pose model?

Validation of a YOLOv8-pose model involves assessing its accuracy using the same dataset parameters retained during training. Here's an example:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.pt")  # load an official model
model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom model

# Validate the model
metrics = model.val()  # no arguments needed, dataset and settings remembered
```

For more information, visit the [Val Section](#val).

### Can I export a YOLOv8-pose model to other formats, and how?

Yes, you can export a YOLOv8-pose model to various formats like ONNX, CoreML, TensorRT, and more. This can be done using either Python or the Command Line Interface (CLI).

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.pt")  # load an official model
model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom trained model

# Export the model
model.export(format="onnx")
```

Refer to the [Export Section](#export) for more details.

### What are the available Ultralytics YOLOv8-pose models and their performance metrics?

Ultralytics YOLOv8 offers various pretrained pose models such as YOLOv8n-pose, YOLOv8s-pose, YOLOv8m-pose, among others. These models differ in size, accuracy (mAP), and speed. For instance, the YOLOv8n-pose model achieves a mAP<sup>pose</sup>50-95 of 50.4 and an mAP<sup>pose</sup>50 of 80.1. For a complete list and performance details, visit the [Models Section](#models).
