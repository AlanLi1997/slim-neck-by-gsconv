ðŸ“š This guide explains how to **freeze** YOLOv5 ðŸš€ layers when **[transfer learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/transfer-learning)**. Transfer learning is a useful way to quickly retrain a model on new data without having to retrain the entire network. Instead, part of the initial weights are frozen in place, and the rest of the weights are used to compute loss and are updated by the optimizer. This requires less resources than normal training and allows for faster training times, though it may also result in reductions to final trained accuracy.

## Before You Start

Clone repo and install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt) in a [**Python>=3.8.0**](https://www.python.org/) environment, including [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). [Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) and [datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/data) download automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
```

## Freeze Backbone

All layers that match the train.py `freeze` list in train.py will be frozen by setting their gradients to zero before training starts.

```python
# Freeze
freeze = [f"model.{x}." for x in range(freeze)]  # layers to freeze
for k, v in model.named_parameters():
    v.requires_grad = True  # train all layers
    if any(x in k for x in freeze):
        print(f"freezing {k}")
        v.requires_grad = False
```

To see a list of module names:

```python
for k, v in model.named_parameters():
    print(k)

"""Output:
model.0.conv.conv.weight
model.0.conv.bn.weight
model.0.conv.bn.bias
model.1.conv.weight
model.1.bn.weight
model.1.bn.bias
model.2.cv1.conv.weight
model.2.cv1.bn.weight
...
model.23.m.0.cv2.bn.weight
model.23.m.0.cv2.bn.bias
model.24.m.0.weight
model.24.m.0.bias
model.24.m.1.weight
model.24.m.1.bias
model.24.m.2.weight
model.24.m.2.bias
"""
```

Looking at the model architecture we can see that the model backbone is layers 0-9:

```yaml
# YOLOv5 v6.0 backbone
backbone:
    # [from, number, module, args]
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [64, 6, 2, 2]] # 0-P1/2
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [128, 3, 2]] # 1-P2/4
    - [-1, 3, C3, [128]]
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [256, 3, 2]] # 3-P3/8
    - [-1, 6, C3, [256]]
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [512, 3, 2]] # 5-P4/16
    - [-1, 9, C3, [512]]
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [1024, 3, 2]] # 7-P5/32
    - [-1, 3, C3, [1024]]
    - [-1, 1, SPPF, [1024, 5]] # 9

# YOLOv5 v6.0 head
head:
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [512, 1, 1]]
    - [-1, 1, nn.Upsample, [None, 2, "nearest"]]
    - [[-1, 6], 1, Concat, [1]] # cat backbone P4
    - [-1, 3, C3, [512, False]] # 13

    - [-1, 1, Conv, [256, 1, 1]]
    - [-1, 1, nn.Upsample, [None, 2, "nearest"]]
    - [[-1, 4], 1, Concat, [1]] # cat backbone P3
    - [-1, 3, C3, [256, False]] # 17 (P3/8-small)

    - [-1, 1, Conv, [256, 3, 2]]
    - [[-1, 14], 1, Concat, [1]] # cat head P4
    - [-1, 3, C3, [512, False]] # 20 (P4/16-medium)

    - [-1, 1, Conv, [512, 3, 2]]
    - [[-1, 10], 1, Concat, [1]] # cat head P5
    - [-1, 3, C3, [1024, False]] # 23 (P5/32-large)

    - [[17, 20, 23], 1, Detect, [nc]] # Detect(P3, P4, P5)
```

so we can define the freeze list to contain all modules with 'model.0.' - 'model.9.' in their names:

```bash
python train.py --freeze 10
```

## Freeze All Layers

To freeze the full model except for the final output convolution layers in Detect(), we set freeze list to contain all modules with 'model.0.' - 'model.23.' in their names:

```bash
python train.py --freeze 24
```

## Results

We train YOLOv5m on VOC on both of the above scenarios, along with a default model (no freezing), starting from the official COCO pretrained `--weights yolov5m.pt`:

```bash
train.py --batch 48 --weights yolov5m.pt --data voc.yaml --epochs 50 --cache --img 512 --hyp hyp.finetune.yaml
```

### Accuracy Comparison

The results show that freezing speeds up training, but reduces final [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) slightly.

### GPU Utilization Comparison

Interestingly, the more modules are frozen the less GPU memory is required to train, and the lower GPU utilization. This indicates that larger models, or models trained at larger --image-size may benefit from freezing in order to train faster.
